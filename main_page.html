              <h3>about</h3>
              <p> Ogygia was an island paradise in Greek mythology that could only be found by someone who wasn't looking for it. It could only be found once because after visiting Ogygia, you knew what you were looking for. The purpose of this channel is to document our first time trying new and exciting things because you only get one shot to experience something for the very first time. </p>
